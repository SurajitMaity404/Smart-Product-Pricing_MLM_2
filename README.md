# Smart-Product-Pricing_MLM_2
This model integrates BERT for text features and ResNet-50 for image features to predict product prices. It extracts embeddings from product descriptions and images, combines them, and trains a deep neural network to estimate prices. The model uses PyTorch, transformers, and scikit-learn for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
